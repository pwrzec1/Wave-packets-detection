This program is a scientific project created to detect pulses in an acoustic circular waveguide. We wrote our program in the Octave script language.

We organized our program in the following files:
- signal_power.m
- signal_power_fragment.m
- signal_db.m
- level_correction.m
- sound_level_fragment.m
- searching_for_impulses.m
- maxima_statistics.m
- calculation_of_errors_paralell.m
